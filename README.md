# zathras

I wanted to get more seriously into more modern C++, bitboards, and eventually a multithreaded chess engine.

So I got started on Zathras, named after my favourite character from the Babylon 5 universe.

I only got as far as using modern C++ async I/O capabilities, but making it truly multithreaded would eventually have made the "Zathras" name very fitting.
