# CLAUDE.md - Zathras Chess Engine

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the Zathras chess engine codebase.

## Repository Overview

**Zathras** is a chess engine written in C++17 that implements the UCI (Universal Chess Interface) protocol. The project focuses on correctness and educational value over performance optimization.

**Technology Stack**: C++17, Make build system, UCI protocol  
**Current Version**: 0.5.2 baseline (stable)  
**Working Directory**: `/home/nczempin/git/zathras/`  
**Platform**: Linux (WSL2)

## Project Status and Branch Strategy

### Current Stable Baseline: Version 0.5.2

**IMPORTANT**: As of June 2025, the project uses dev branch (commit be5a972) as the stable foundation for all development, representing v0.5.2 with cleaned build system and fixed CI.

**Branch Strategy**:
- `main`: Production-ready releases 
- `dev`: Default development branch (currently v0.5.2 stable baseline)
- `feature/ZTH-*`: Feature branches following git flow (PROJECT_ID: ZTH)

**Repository Default Branch**: `dev` (set in GitHub)

## Current Work Status (June 2025)

### Recent Stabilization (v0.5.2)
- ‚úÖ **Build System**: Now uses separate build/ directory for object files
- ‚úÖ **CI Pipeline**: Consolidated into single comprehensive job
- ‚úÖ **Perft Testing**: Limited to depths 2-4 as requested
- ‚úÖ **Repository Cleanup**: Established clean v0.5.2 baseline

### Completed Work (2025-06-26)
- ‚úÖ **Issue #105**: Implemented divide command for perft debugging
- üîÑ **Issue #98-104**: PARTIALLY FIXED - Restored promotion move generation
  - ‚úÖ Generates 4 moves per promotion (Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight)
  - ‚úÖ Correctly sets promoted pieces on the board
  - ‚úÖ Fixed unmake_move to properly restore pawns after promotions
  - ‚úÖ Move display shows promotion notation (e.g., "e7e8q")
  - ‚úÖ UCI parsing handles promotion moves
  - ‚úÖ Simple promotion position perft 2 = 41 (correct)
  - ‚ùå Some edge cases still failing (e.g., promotions on a-file)
  - ‚ùå Position 4 perft 4 still incorrect

### Known Issues
- üêõ **NEW Issue**: Pregenerated pawn move tables have incorrect square mapping
  - File coordinates are flipped (a-file moves show as h-file)
  - Affects promotion move generation on edge files
  - Root cause: `set_square()` uses `7 - file_to` instead of `file_to`
  - This is a SEPARATE issue from the promotion fixes

## Build System

### Key Commands

```bash
# Build the engine (uses build/ directory)
make clean && make

# Test basic functionality  
echo -e "uci\nquit" | ./zathras

# Run perft tests
echo -e "uci\nposition startpos\nperft 4\nquit" | ./zathras
```

### Makefile Configuration

The Makefile uses separate build directory:

```makefile
BUILD_DIR=build
CPP_OBJ=$(patsubst %.cpp,$(BUILD_DIR)/%.o,$(SRC))

$(BUILD_DIR):
	mkdir -p $(BUILD_DIR)/src $(BUILD_DIR)/zathras_lib/src

$(BUILD_DIR)/%.o: %.cpp
	$(CC) -o $@ -c $(CFLAGS) $<
```

## Testing and Validation

### Expected Perft Results (after promotion fix)
- Simple promotion perft 2: 41 moves (position: 4k3/P7/8/8/8/8/8/4K3 w - - 0 1)
- Starting position perft 3: 8,902 moves
- Starting position perft 4: 197,281 moves

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Single comprehensive job (build + extended perft validation)
- Runs on push to dev branch
- Tests perft depths 2-4 as requested
- Includes linting and build artifact upload

## Development Workflow

### Git Flow Pattern
1. **Feature Development**: Create `feature/ZTH-{issue}-{title}` branches from `dev`
2. **Testing**: Ensure perft tests pass before merge
3. **Integration**: Merge feature branches back to `dev` 
4. **Releases**: Merge `dev` to `main` for stable releases

### Branch Naming Convention
- **Feature branches**: `feature/ZTH-{issue-number}-{description}`
- **PROJECT ID**: ZTH (Zathras)
- **Target branch**: All feature PRs should target `dev`

## Known Issues and Current Tasks

### Issue #98-104: Promotion Move Generation
**Status**: PARTIALLY COMPLETE (2025-06-26) - Ready for PR

**Completed**:
1. ‚úÖ Restored Move_type enum with PROMOTION_QUEEN, PROMOTION_ROOK, PROMOTION_BISHOP, PROMOTION_KNIGHT
2. ‚úÖ Fixed visit_pawn_caps() to generate 4 promotion moves  
3. ‚úÖ Fixed visit_pawn_nocaps() to generate 4 promotion moves
4. ‚úÖ Fixed make_move/unmake_move promotion handling (including pawn restoration bug)
5. ‚úÖ Restored UCI promotion parsing
6. ‚úÖ Fixed Move display to show promotion notation

**Known Issues**:
- Black pawn promotions on a-file not working correctly
- Position 4 perft 4 still shows discrepancies
- Related to pregenerated move table bug below

### NEW Issue: Pregenerated Move Table Bug
**Status**: Discovered but NOT FIXED

**Problem**: Pawn move pregeneration has incorrect square mapping
- Files are flipped: `to_twisted = 7 - file_to + rank_to * 8`
- Should be: `to = file_to + rank_to * 8`
- Affects pawn moves, especially promotions on a-file and h-file
- This is a SEPARATE bug from the promotion generation issue

### Issue #97: CI Optimization
**Status**: Completed for now - consolidated CI into single job

## Development Commands
```bash
# Build system
make clean && make        # Clean build using build/ directory

# Engine testing  
echo -e "uci\nquit" | ./zathras                                    # Test UCI interface
echo -e "uci\nposition startpos\nperft 3\nquit" | ./zathras        # Performance test

# Git workflow
git checkout dev                                    # Switch to dev branch
git checkout -b feature/ZTH-{issue}-{title}        # Create feature branch
git push -u origin feature/ZTH-{issue}-{title}     # Push new branch
```

## Notes for Claude Code

### Critical Reminders
- **Work from dev branch** - this is the stable v0.5.2 baseline
- **Use proper ZTH-{issue} branch naming** with GitHub issue tracking
- **Validate with perft testing** before considering changes successful
- **Document significant changes** in this file
- **Build system uses build/ directory** - don't put object files in src/

### Development Priorities
1. **Fix promotion bug** (Issue #98) - critical for perft accuracy
2. **Maintain v0.5.2 stability** - avoid breaking existing functionality
3. **Systematic approach** - use GitHub issues and proper git flow
4. **CI validation** - ensure all tests pass before merging

### Emergency Recovery
If context is lost:
1. **Check current branch**: Should be on `feature/ZTH-*` or `dev`
2. **Check build**: `make clean && make` should succeed
3. **Test basic perft**: Should get 8902 for perft 3 on starting position
4. **Read this file**: Check current work status and priorities
