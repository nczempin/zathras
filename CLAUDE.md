# CLAUDE.md - Zathras Chess Engine

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the Zathras chess engine codebase.

## Repository Overview

**Zathras** is a chess engine written in C++17 that implements the UCI (Universal Chess Interface) protocol. The project focuses on correctness and educational value over performance optimization.

**Technology Stack**: C++17, Make build system, UCI protocol  
**Current Version**: 0.5.2 baseline (stable)  
**Working Directory**: `/home/nczempin/git/zathras/`  
**Platform**: Linux (WSL2)

## Project Status and Branch Strategy

### Current Stable Baseline: Version 0.5.2

**IMPORTANT**: As of June 2025, the project uses dev branch (commit be5a972) as the stable foundation for all development, representing v0.5.2 with cleaned build system and fixed CI.

**Branch Strategy**:
- `main`: Production-ready releases 
- `dev`: Default development branch (currently v0.5.2 stable baseline)
- `feature/ZTH-*`: Feature branches following git flow (PROJECT_ID: ZTH)

**Repository Default Branch**: `dev` (set in GitHub)

## Current Work Status (June 2025)

### Recent Stabilization (v0.5.2)
- ‚úÖ **Build System**: Now uses separate build/ directory for object files
- ‚úÖ **CI Pipeline**: Consolidated into single comprehensive job
- ‚úÖ **Perft Testing**: Limited to depths 2-4 as requested
- ‚úÖ **Repository Cleanup**: Established clean v0.5.2 baseline

### Completed Work (2025-06-26)
- ‚úÖ **Issue #105**: Implemented divide command for perft debugging
- ‚úÖ **Issue #110**: Fixed divide command bug (was showing move count instead of perft)
- ‚úÖ **Issue #98-104**: COMPLETED - Restored promotion move generation
  - ‚úÖ Generates 4 moves per promotion (Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight)
  - ‚úÖ Correctly sets promoted pieces on the board
  - ‚úÖ Fixed unmake_move to properly restore pawns after promotions
  - ‚úÖ Move display shows promotion notation (e.g., "e7e8q")
  - ‚úÖ UCI parsing handles promotion moves
  - ‚úÖ All promotion tests pass (simple, edge files, Position 5)

### Known Issues
- üêõ **Issue #109**: Position 4 perft 4 incorrect (422,598 instead of 422,333)
  - This is the ONLY confirmed perft failure
  - All promotion tests pass correctly
  - Needs investigation using divide command

## Build System

### Key Commands

```bash
# Build the engine (uses build/ directory)
make clean && make

# Test basic functionality  
echo -e "uci\nquit" | ./zathras

# Run perft tests
echo -e "uci\nposition startpos\nperft 4\nquit" | ./zathras
```

### Makefile Configuration

The Makefile uses separate build directory:

```makefile
BUILD_DIR=build
CPP_OBJ=$(patsubst %.cpp,$(BUILD_DIR)/%.o,$(SRC))

$(BUILD_DIR):
	mkdir -p $(BUILD_DIR)/src $(BUILD_DIR)/zathras_lib/src

$(BUILD_DIR)/%.o: %.cpp
	$(CC) -o $@ -c $(CFLAGS) $<
```

## Testing and Validation

### Expected Perft Results (after promotion fix)
- Simple promotion perft 2: 41 moves (position: 4k3/P7/8/8/8/8/8/4K3 w - - 0 1)
- Starting position perft 3: 8,902 moves
- Starting position perft 4: 197,281 moves

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Single comprehensive job (build + extended perft validation)
- Runs on push to dev branch
- Tests perft depths 2-4 as requested
- Includes linting and build artifact upload

## Development Workflow

### Git Flow Pattern
1. **Feature Development**: Create `feature/ZTH-{issue}-{title}` branches from `dev`
2. **Testing**: Ensure perft tests pass before merge
3. **Integration**: Merge feature branches back to `dev` 
4. **Releases**: Merge `dev` to `main` for stable releases

### Branch Naming Convention
- **Feature branches**: `feature/ZTH-{issue-number}-{description}`
- **PROJECT ID**: ZTH (Zathras)
- **Target branch**: All feature PRs should target `dev`

## Known Issues and Current Tasks

### Issue #98-104: Promotion Move Generation
**Status**: COMPLETED (2025-06-26)

**Completed**:
1. ‚úÖ Restored Move_type enum with PROMOTION_QUEEN, PROMOTION_ROOK, PROMOTION_BISHOP, PROMOTION_KNIGHT
2. ‚úÖ Fixed visit_pawn_caps() to generate 4 promotion moves  
3. ‚úÖ Fixed visit_pawn_nocaps() to generate 4 promotion moves
4. ‚úÖ Fixed make_move/unmake_move promotion handling (including pawn restoration bug)
5. ‚úÖ Restored UCI promotion parsing
6. ‚úÖ Fixed Move display to show promotion notation
7. ‚úÖ All promotion tests pass including edge files

### Issue #109: Position 4 perft 4 incorrect
**Status**: Open - Only confirmed bug

**Problem**: Position 4 perft 4 returns 422,598 instead of 422,333 (+265 moves)
- All 6 legal moves show slightly higher counts than Stockfish
- Needs investigation using divide command to narrow down the issue

### Issue #97: CI Optimization
**Status**: Completed for now - consolidated CI into single job

## Development Commands
```bash
# Build system
make clean && make        # Clean build using build/ directory

# Engine testing  
echo -e "uci\nquit" | ./zathras                                    # Test UCI interface
echo -e "uci\nposition startpos\nperft 3\nquit" | ./zathras        # Performance test

# Git workflow
git checkout dev                                    # Switch to dev branch
git checkout -b feature/ZTH-{issue}-{title}        # Create feature branch
git push -u origin feature/ZTH-{issue}-{title}     # Push new branch
```

## Notes for Claude Code

### Critical Reminders
- **Work from dev branch** - this is the stable v0.5.2 baseline
- **Use proper ZTH-{issue} branch naming** with GitHub issue tracking
- **Validate with perft testing** before considering changes successful
- **Document significant changes** in this file
- **Build system uses build/ directory** - don't put object files in src/

### Development Priorities
1. **Fix Position 4 perft 4** (Issue #109) - only remaining perft failure
2. **Maintain v0.5.2 stability** - avoid breaking existing functionality
3. **Systematic approach** - use GitHub issues and proper git flow
4. **CI validation** - ensure all tests pass before merging

### Emergency Recovery
If context is lost:
1. **Check current branch**: Should be on `feature/ZTH-*` or `dev`
2. **Check build**: `make clean && make` should succeed
3. **Test basic perft**: Should get 8902 for perft 3 on starting position
4. **Read this file**: Check current work status and priorities
